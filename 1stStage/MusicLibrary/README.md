## Purpose

The objective for the 1st stage of the assignment was to implement the following:

- Terminal based User Interface, with all menus and sub-menus completed. 
- File I/O.
- Data validation.

## How to compile

Compilation of this application requires the following:

- Java

From the root directory, compile and execute the application with the following commands:

```bash
javac *.java
java MusicLibrary
```

## Usage

This application requires the inclusion of an externally produced class:

- ``MusicStub.class``

This class, which we were provided with, was used to check if our data validation processes correctly filtered out invalid data.
