# Music Library

Object Oriented Program Design: Assignment

Semester 2, 2018

Author: Lakshan Martin

## Purpose

This assignment was designed as an introduction to the application of Object Oriented Programming (OOPD). 

The assignment specification was designed to highlight the significant advantages of OOPD as we were required to completed the Assignment in stages. With each stage requiring refactorisation of our code as we implement basic OOPD concepts.

The overall task was split into three separate stages:

- **Stage 1**
  - Implementation of menus/submenus
  - File I/O
  - Data validation of user and file input
- **Stage 2**
  - Full functionality implemented
  - Data storage of user and file input (Arrays)
  - Implementation of basic Object Orientation
- **Stage 3**
  - Implementation of Object Inheritance

## Task

Create a music media library. The library will be able to perform the following:

- Store details of music stored on Records, Cassettes,  and Digitally.
- Read the library details from an input file.
- Add songs to library based on user input.
- Calculate the total play time of all songs stored in the library.
- Find a specific song (based on first occurrence name matches) and print the play instructions for that song.
- Allow the user to select a media type and option, and then print number of songs and total run time for that type:
  - Records, and the record play speed.
  - Cassettes, and the tape side.
  - Digital, and the file type.
- Save the library to a .csv file.
